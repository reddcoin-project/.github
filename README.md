# Reddcoin Project

ReddCoin (RDD) is a decentralized blockchain network launched in 2014 and designed for social payments, tipping, and micro-transactions.

The network operates using a Proof-of-Stake-Velocity (PoSV v2) consensus mechanism and enables low-cost peer-to-peer digital value transfer without centralized control.
