# Reddcoin Project

Reddcoin (RDD) is the original social currency — a digital asset purpose-built for tipping, micropayments, and rewarding content across social platforms. Launched in 2014 with a unique Proof-of-Stake-Velocity (PoSV) consensus mechanism, Reddcoin incentivizes both ownership and active participation in the network. Our mission is to make digital currency accessible, social, and seamlessly integrated into everyday online interactions.

We're actively developing the next generation of Reddcoin infrastructure, including protocol upgrades (SegWit, Taproot), the ReddID decentralized identity system, cross-chain bridges, NFT support, and native social tipping integrations for platforms like Bluesky and the fediverse. Development is guided by our formal [Reddcoin Enhancement Proposal (REP)](https://github.com/reddcoin-project) process. Contributions, feedback, and community participation are always welcome — join us on [Telegram](https://t.me/reddcoin) or explore our repositories to get involved.
